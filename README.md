# VC4-CLI
Command line interface to operate a Crestron Virtual Control server application from the Linux Shell
The VC4 CLI leverages the Crestron Virtual control REST API with a loopback IP address 
to provide a localized CLI for the VC4 service. This CLI 
uses the `BubbleTea` TUI framework for navigation and command line workflows.
